# Lorenz System Visualization

This project uses p5.js to visualize the Lorenz system, a set of differential equations that exhibit chaotic behavior. The program generates a 3D trajectory of the system's evolution over time, allowing users to interact with the visualization. Based on Daniel Shiffman Video.

## Features
- Visualization of the Lorenz system trajectory in 3D
- Color-coded trajectory for visual clarity

## Usage
Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the visualization. Use the mouse to rotate the view and the scroll wheel to zoom in and out.
